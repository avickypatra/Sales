# Salesforce

##  Professional sales managers or marketers will want a broad range of performance monitoring data to enable them to measure their progress and benchmark performance in respect of company forecasts or targets.

## Effectively managing a sales team involves knowing where things are headed at any given time. In the salesanalytics dashboards, you can measure the distance from quota by product or opportunity type and that provides a window into future trends.
